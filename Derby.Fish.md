# Derby.Fish API
Description

The Derby.Fish API server is the central component of the Derby.Fish software suite, acting as the main interface for all interactions with the underlying database. All operations related to data management and user interactions are channeled through this API server.

When a user submits a request through the API, the server first authenticates the user to ensure they have the appropriate permissions. Once authentication is successfully completed, the server processes the request, which may involve creating new posts, updating existing submissions, or modifying user profiles.

By centralizing database interactions through the API server, we provide a secure and consistent way to handle user commands and ensure that all actions are properly authorized and executed.
Key Features

  - Authentication: Validates user identity before processing any requests.
  - Command Execution: Handles a variety of user commands, including creating and updating posts, and modifying user profiles.
  - Centralized Data Management: Manages all database interactions through a single API endpoint to maintain consistency and security.
